## Project's goal

The goal of this project is to create a web-service capable of finding code by a search query, that satisfies given test cases.

If done properly, such a project might save up a lot of time on development, by giving out good solutions to common, formulated requests.

## Technologies

* Flask version: 1.1.1.
* Node.js 12.16.1

(Also see requirements.txt)
 
## Setting up a Flask webserver

To properly set up a server you should navigate to /config/example and move all files from there out to /config, then run Flask/code/\_\_run.py.

## Setting up the Sandbox server

Run `npm install` while in Sandbox/server directory.
(You also need Nodemon installed globally, you can accomplish that by doing `npm install -g nodemon`)
